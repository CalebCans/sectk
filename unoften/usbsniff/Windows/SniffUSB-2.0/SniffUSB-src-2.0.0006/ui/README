* Version 2.0 Introduction - December, 2006
===========================================
The purpose of this update is simply to allow SniffUsb and UsbSnoopy
to be built using currently available development tools. In particular,
Microsoft Visual C++ and the Windows 2000 DDK are deprecated tools that
are no longer available.

This version of the SniffUsb MFC application is an update to the
UsbSniff 1.8 release by by Benoit PAPILLAULT <benoit.papillault@free.fr>.
Benoit deserves a great deal of credit because remarkably little effort
was required to adapt the V1.8 MFC application to be built successfully
under Microsoft Visual Studio 2005.

Some deprecated functions were replaced with newer preferred functions.
Support for Windows versions prior to Windows XP was removed.

Both the application and the driver can be built for Windows x64 Editions.
Extremely limited testing was done on Windows XP x64 Edition, but the
brief tests that were done appeared to be successful.

Extremely limited testing was done on Windows Vista RTM (Build 6000),
but the brief tests that were done were also successful. It is necessary to
use the Vista "Run as administrator..." tool to run UsbSniff on Vista.

* Compile:

Before attempting to build the UsbSniff application it is necessary to build
the UsbSnoop.sys driver using the Windows XP Build Environment of the Microsoft
Vista Windows Driver Kit (WDK 6000). See the README file in the filter folder.

You should compile those source files either in "Win32 Debug" mode
or in "Win32 Release" mode.

Please install the Windows Vista Platform SDK before compiling UsbSniff.

It is not necessary to reference header files from the WDK to build UsbSniff
under Visual Studio 2005 with the companion Windows Vista Platform SDK.

If your compile is ok, the file "sniffusb.exe" will be available.
