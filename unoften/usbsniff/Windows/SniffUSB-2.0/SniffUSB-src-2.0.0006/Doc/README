usbsnoop version 2.0

1. WHAT IS IT?
--------------

usbsnoop is a package design to log USB packet going from your Windows
device driver to your harware device and vice-versa. It works under
Windows NT 2000 only.

2. BUILDING DRIVERS
-------------------
You must install the Microsoft Vista Windows Driver Kit (WDK 6000).

You do _NOT_ use Visual Studio to build the UsbSnoop 2.0 drivers.

Use the Windows XP x86 Build Environments for building x86 versions of the
driver.

Use the Windows Server 2003 x64 Build Environments for building x64 (AMD64)
versions of the driver.

Self-sign the x64 driver if you intend to run it on Windows Vista x64 Edition.


3. COMPILING THE APPLICATION
----------------------------
You must build the drivers before attempting to build the application. The
drivers are loaded into the application resource file and the compilation
will fail if they are not already built.

You should compile those source files either in "Win32 Debug" mode or in
"Win32 Release" mode. You may also select x64 configurations.

You must install Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 and all current updates. After
that, you must also install the Windows Vista Platform SDK before compiling
the UsbSniff application.

It is not necessary to reference header files from the WDK to build UsbSniff
under Visual Studio 2005 with the companion Windows Vista Platform SDK.


4. INSTALLATION
---------------
You will need to install the .NET framework on systems that will run SniffUSB 2.0.

If the necessary MFC and CRT 8 support DLLs are installed, then just run SniffUSB.exe.
It will automatically install the needed drivers (.sys files).
