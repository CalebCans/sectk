Apple USB Debug Kit
These drivers are OSX version dependent.  I've only included a couple of the latest revisions.  Download from the link a driver for your OSX version. Each download package provides both the debug USB drivers and the original drivers should you want to remove the debug feature.

NOTE: "The USB Prober application can be found on the local hard drive at /Developer/Applications/Utilities/USB Prober"
