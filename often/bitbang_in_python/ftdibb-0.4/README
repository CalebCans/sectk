ftdibb -- an easy to use ftdi bit-bang mode library for linux.

The library is designed for the chips from
http://www.ftdichip.com/
It uses libusb from http://libusb.sourceforge.net/

It's tested with the chips:
FT232BM FT232BL FT245BM FT245BL

The examples are written for FT232BM/FT232BL. You have to
change the device IDs for other chips.

Bitbang mode is a special mode of the ftdi serial IO chips
which allows you to use all 8 IO-pins either as input or
output.
You can query the state of each pin at any time  (function ftdibb_getBitMode)
An output pin can be set to 1 (=+5V) or 0 (=0V). It will stay in this
state until you change it again.

See bitbang_example.c and bitbang_runlight_example.c for examples.
The corresponding circuit diagram is circuitbitbang_example.pdf

You must be root when you run the examples (see below).
The kernel module for the usb to rs232 converter function (ftdi_sio)
must not be loaded otherwise libusb will get into access conflicts.

-------
Installation:
1) get libusb and install it
2) edit the make file and Makefile an adjust the path for
   libusb at the beginning of the file
3) type: make
4) try the examples
5) to use ftdibb just copy ftdibb.c and ftdibb.h into your
   application. The files are so small that it makes no sense
   to make a real runtime linked library.
-------
ftdibb uses libusb to send usb-urbs (messages) to the chip:
http://libusb.sourceforge.net/

A limitation of libusb is that it uses the /proc filesystem to send
and receive urbs. This means under linux that you have to run everything
as root.
It is possible to use the suid binaries to work around this.
It would be possible to extend the existing ftdi_sio kernel module
with BitBang functionality but this would require a kernel patch.

Pre-compiled examples are available in the bin directory.
