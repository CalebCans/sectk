tool for searching signatures inside files, extremely useful as help in reversing works like figuring or having an initial idea of what encryption/compression algorithm is used for a proprietary protocol or file.
it can recognize tons of compression, multimedia and encryption algorithms and many other things like known strings and anti-debugging code which can be also manually added since it's all based on a text signature file read at runtime and easy to modify.
